<p>This is a project written in C++ and SDL. This was going to be a game using a 2.5d camera. Now, it's just a 2.5d camera, for anyone to use. I still might work on a game using this engine, but for now, it's an engine that uses a pseudo-3d camera.</p>
<p>Its source code is published on GitHub at <a href="https://www.github.com/xianbaum/punching-out-cthulhu">https://www.github.com/xianbaum/punching-out-cthulhu</a></p>
