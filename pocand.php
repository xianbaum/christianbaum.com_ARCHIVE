<p>This is an Android version of POC. This is an old project, but I still keep the code to compare the C++/SDL version that I rewrote. It's the same thing as <a href="../poc/">this</a>, but written in Java and AndEngine rather than C++ and SDL. This project was long before I started using version control, so I do not have a working source version, nor do I have the source of the binary.</p>
<p><a href="files/oldandapps/PunchingOutCthulhuOld.apk">Download working executable (.apk)</a> - This is an .apk file. It only runs on Android operating systems or Android emulators.
<p><a href="files/pocand.zip">Download source (.zip)</a> -The source compiles but running it does nothing. It was abandoned in favor of the <a href="poc.php">SDL version</a>
