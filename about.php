<h2>I'm a programmer.</h2>
<hr />
<p>I have a degree from Park University, where I majored in Computer Science. I am proficient in many programming languages, especially C, Java, Javascript, Python and PHP, but I enjoy other programming languages, too.</p>
<p>All my life, I have been obsessed with computers. When I was in the first grade, I remember tinkering with HTML, trying to find all the single-letter tags. I learned my first programming language, Blitz Basic, when I was 10 after I received the book <cite>Game Programming for Teens</cite>. In Blitz Basic, I programmed while still in elementary school.</p>
<p>In my free time, I like to program applications and games, and run. Kat's Dream, one such game, was published on the Google Play store on January 2016 and recieves frequent updates.</p>
<p>While I was in college, I worked part-time as a custodian. Having lived in Spokane, WA most of my life, I am currently in Phoenix AZ, curious what the future has in store.</p>
